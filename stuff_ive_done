Questions:
> How can we deal with interstellar extinction best?
> An apparent magnitude prior seems like a good shout/maybe the NN will work this out


Stuff I could do:
> Make my own mixture density network api, consisting of a class that during initialisation makes an mdn to requisite specs
  - this would make the code a shit ton more readable
  - it would make it really easy to launch multiple graphs but comparing settings between them
  - I need to change to using the 'with my_graph.as_default():' notation to help with this

- Got an MDN example working!!! YAY (maybe)
- I had bigtime issues with tf.subtract() broadcasting not working. I *hope* that the cheeky fix I've done works.
- I'm not currently reproducing loss functions as low as in the Edward example, so fingers crossed it's even actually working.




22/10/18
- Got the blog example running on my computer
- Started investigating how MDNs work in tensorflow
- Found quite a few useful packages but struggled to get inter-compatibility
- Decided to plow on with using only tensorflow. It will be a bit harder but will save a hell of a lot of compatibility issues.
- Started on an example mdn!
