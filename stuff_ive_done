Questions:
> How can we deal with interstellar extinction best?
> An apparent magnitude prior seems like a good shout/maybe the NN will work this out


Stuff I could do:
> Look at the stack exchange Shoham linked to me and write down the optimum number of layers to use etc
> Add MAP and 50/50 value estimation to MixtureDensityNetwork and also add some plotting tools to show distributions at a specific data point (will be very useful for redshifts)

26/10/18
- Changed loss functions to now use a class system (lol)
- Added regularisation to MixtureDensityNetwork
- MixtureDensityNetwork.validate() now returns output in a dictionary, with keys that are loss-function specific
- Regularisation improves the code on the test example
- The MDN code I have is now very ready for action, yay!

25/10/18
- Finished the barebones and testing of the MDN class!
- Added some gorgeous running helping (mostly modified from BATDOG), including ETAs and reporting only every few seconds
- This class is a total fucking babe because you can easily change parameters in the network like number of layers, size etc
- Some basic analysis has been added, like a loss function evolution plotter. Could do with adding MAP estimation.
- Also it only supports one lossfunc type (with no regularisation) atm and that sucks lol

24/10/18
- Started work on an MDN class to make the code a lot nicer

23/10/18
- Got an MDN example working!!! YAY (maybe)
- I had bigtime issues with tf.subtract() broadcasting not working. I *hope* that the cheeky fix I've done works.
- I'm not currently reproducing loss functions as low as in the Edward example, so fingers crossed it's even actually working.

22/10/18
- Got the blog example running on my computer
- Started investigating how MDNs work in tensorflow
- Found quite a few useful packages but struggled to get inter-compatibility
- Decided to plow on with using only tensorflow. It will be a bit harder but will save a hell of a lot of compatibility issues.
- Started on an example mdn!

---- Week IV ----


- had the fucking presentation

---- Week III

10/10/18
- Fuck BUCS lol, moving my shit!!1!
- Fixed the above
- Finished reading Brammer. Lots of useful stuff has come from reading it methinks.
- Started reading Quadri


09/10/18
- Worked on IMI poster again (u lazy aha)
- 

08/10/18
- More of Brammer
- Worked on my IMI poster instead

---- Week II ----


05/10/18
- Sorted Npairs vs deltaZ
- Now also overplotting a Gaussian
- Started reading Brammer, Quadri

04/10/18
- Done the zphot vs zspec plot
- Almost there on Npairs vs deltaZ, just need to make sure no invalid redshifts get added

03/10/18
- Read upto chapter 4 of Raschke

02/10/18
- XDrive mounted
- Started reading some Raschke stuff

01/10/18
- Got some of the ssh stuff working

---- Week I ----
